<h1>Xobpord Team Project - API</h1>

<h3>About the App:</h3>
<p>This application allows users to house any type of file for safe-keeping. Just sign up for the app with an email address and password, log in, and start uploading your files. For each file, the user will have the options to download, edit, and delete. Users can upload one or more files at once. We are currently allowing users to view a preview of their .jpg, .png, gif, and gifv files, and might expand this feature to other file types in the future if it proves to be valuable based on user feedback.</p>
<p>Users can set files to be public or private, but only file owners can make changes. To make sharing public files simple, we have added a file sharing feature where a user can copy the URL to his/her clipboard and another user can view the file without signing in.</p>

<h3>Planning and Strategy:</h3>
<p>Our team was given the challenge of creating a file bucket. We began by determining team norms and general processes, followed by a discussion regarding how to approach the project. We wrote user stories using Trello, created wireframes, as well as an ERD. Here is the schedule we followed:</p>
<ol>
<li>Basic setup of API template</li>
<li>Basic setup of browser template</li>
<li>Set up authentication and upload functionality on the backend and test via Postman</li>
<li>Add authentication functionality to client and test in browser</li>
<li>Add basic file upload, edit, and delete functionality to client and test in browser</li>
<li>Refactor file structure to enhance organization of code</li>
<li>Add additional features beyond basic requirements</li>
<li>Add styling and enhance user experience</li>
<li>Test all functionality end-to-end</li>
</ol>
<p>As we came across difficult problems, we worked together as a team and used online resources to tackle them quickly. Pair programming proved to be highly effective when it came time to tackle complex issues, and it was especially valuable to understand how different developers might take various approaches in programming.</p>

<h3>Future Fixes and Enhancements:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Impose a total maximum file size limit for a user's account.</li>
<li>Improve file structure and allow users to create folders.</li>
<li>Add preview support for all file types.</li>
<li>Allow users to assign collaborators for their files.</li>
<li>Show progress bar when users are uploading files.</li>
</li>
